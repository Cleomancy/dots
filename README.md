# Glorious dotfiles
Dotfiles for my custom [larbs.xyz](https://larbs.xyz/) config in which I trim stuff I didn't need and changed some shortcuts.

To deploy them with my custom builds of DWM and friends, I made a script:

```jeff.sh
curl -LO https://cleomancy.github.io/rice.sh
```

Also taken from the larbs script but I made it less user friendly.
I'm sure it works the same but since I only use it right after a bare install of Artix, I removed the user checking logic.
